# openpilot tools

## System Requirements

openpilot is developed and tested on **Ubuntu 20.04**, which is the primary development target aside from the [supported embedded hardware](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot#running-on-a-dedicated-device-in-a-car). We also have a CI test to verify that openpilot builds on macOS, but the tools are untested. For the best experience, stick to Ubuntu 20.04, otherwise openpilot and the tools should work with minimal to no modifications on macOS and other Linux systems.

## Setup your PC
First, open devcontainer.

Second, clone openpilot:
``` bash
cd ~
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/commaai/openpilot.git

# or do a partial clone instead for a faster clone and smaller repo size
git clone --filter=blob:none --recurse-submodules --also-filter-submodules https://github.com/commaai/openpilot.git

cd openpilot
```

Then, run the setup script:

``` bash
# for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
tools/ubuntu_setup.sh

# for macOS
tools/mac_setup.sh
```

Activate a shell with the Python dependencies installed:

``` bash
cd openpilot && poetry shell
```

Build openpilot with this command:
``` bash
scons -u -j$(nproc)
```

### Dev Container

openpilot supports [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/). Dev containers provide customizable and consistent development environment wrapped inside a container. This means you can develop in a designated environment matching our primary development target, regardless of your local setup.

Dev containers are supported in [multiple editors and IDEs](https://containers.dev/supporting), including [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

#### X11 forwarding on macOS

GUI apps like `ui` or `cabana` can also run inside the container by leveraging X11 forwarding. To make use of it on macOS, additional configuration steps must be taken. Follow [these](https://gist.github.com/sorny/969fe55d85c9b0035b0109a31cbcb088) steps to setup X11 forwarding on macOS.

### Windows

Neither openpilot nor any of the tools are developed or tested on Windows, but the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) should provide a similar experience to native Ubuntu. [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions) specifically has been reported by several users to be a seamless experience.

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to setup the WSL and install the `Ubuntu-20.04` distribution. Once your Ubuntu WSL environment is setup, follow the Linux setup instructions to finish setting up your environment. See [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps) for running GUI apps.

**NOTE**: If you are running WSL and any GUIs are failing (segfaulting or other strange issues) even after following the steps above, you may need to enable software rendering with `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1`, e.g. `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 selfdrive/ui/ui`.
